Objective: Design a torque wrench that meets provided saftey factor requirements and strain gauge sensitivity. Test and verify design using finite element modeling in ANSYS. 

The material used for this torque wrench design is a titanium alpha-beta alloy, Ti-6Al-7Nb. It is often used for replacement hip joints. It has a Young’s modulus of 14500 ksi, a yield strength of 130 ksi, a Poisson’s ratio of 0.35, and a fatigue strength of approximately 88 ksi.

To ensure the FEM model had loads and constraints similar to reality I applied displacement constraint to top 0.4in of drive to mimic an actual torque wrench. A load of 37.5lb (corresponds to the torque of 600psi) was applied to the face on the end, distributed across the face. 

The strain gauge recorded a maximum strain of 7.2757E-4, which was the normal x-strain. The maximum normal stress was 90837 psi, located on the drive at the point where the constraint is no longer applicable. The load point deflection is 0.27087 in. 

The torque wrench sensitivity is 727570 mV/V, based on the maximum strain the probe collected. 

The strain gauge used was a strain probe at a specific point. The probe was 1 inch from the midpoint of the drive, two inches from the drive end of the handle. It was centered on the face on the edge of a handle, with a height from the bottom of 0.25in.
