For Intro to Mechanical Design, we had a semester long design project. In groups of six, we worked on finding a problem and devising an engineering solution to it. My group decided to focus on making an umbrella small enough to be a keychain while being resilient flipping and breaking in harsh winds. 

Using Autodesk Fusion 360, I designed the umbrella's ribs, testing them using the CAD before laser cutting them from acrylic. A groupmate designed the connectors, which were 3D printed. 

Our final prototype, while less than ideal, was able to open, close, and protect from the rain while also being small.
