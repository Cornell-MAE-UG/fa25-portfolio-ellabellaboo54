As a part of my Thermodynamics class, we chose a system we learned about in class to study in more detail. I chose a rocket nozzle, as we discussed nozzles in Thermodynamics and went into more detail in Introductory Fluid Mechanics. 

Rocket nozzles are converging/diverging nozzles that are designed to speed up fluid flow to create thrust for the rocket. As seen in the diagram, there is a combuster at the beginning of the nozzle, which increases the temperature and pressure of the fluid. The converging section of the nozzle speeds up the fluid flow, converting the temperature and pressure into kinetic energy, until it reached Mach 1 at the throat. From there, the nozzle diverges to continue increase the speed of the flow. This is because for speeds less than the speed of sound, a converging nozzle speeds up the fluid, but once it reached Mach 1 and greater, diverging areas allow the fluid to speed up even more. 

To analyze the nozzle, you use a control volume analysis. We assume that the only change in energy is due to work. By relating the change in energy due to work to the fluid's internal and kinetic energy change, we can use conservation of energy to find an equation relating the initial and final enthalpies and speeds. 

The mass flow rate is assumed to be choked, meaning that properties downstream do not affect the mass flow, and it only relies on combustion properties as well as the throat area. 

There are other formulas used due to the isentropic flow assumption that allow for calculations of final speed, pressure, temperature, and density of the fluid as it exits the nozzle, but those are above the scope of this class. They do, however, relate the stagnation, or combustion, properties to the final properties of the nozzle.
